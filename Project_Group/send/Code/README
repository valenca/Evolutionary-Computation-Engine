To run the program for the self-adaptive version use the next command:
- pypy ec.py


To run the program for the fixed version with value 5 do the following:
- change line 131 in file Library/mutation.py to:
    individual['gen'][j] += gauss(0, self.values['sigma'])
- run
    pypy ec.py


To run the program for the fixed version with value 10 do the following:
- change line 131 in file Library/mutation.py to:
    individual['gen'][j] += gauss(0, self.values['sigma'])
- change line 76 in file Library/values.py to:
    self.values['sigma'] = 10
- run
    pypy ec.py


The execution of the program will generate two files:
- output
    contains all data (population, best_fitnesses, average_fitnesses)
    for every generation and for every run
- output2
    contains the variation of the sigma on the self-adaptive version
